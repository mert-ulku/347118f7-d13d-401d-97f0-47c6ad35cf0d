## About the assignment

Since an API wasn't provided, i took initiative and used (https://swapi.dev/) as my data source. To meet some of the requirements of the assignment, i have added some extra fields such as price and in stock to the data upon the initial API request.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
